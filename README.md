# leafletQt_CPP
A Qt application with an embedded leaflet display - Test purposes only

This is the C++ implementation. For a breakdown of leaflet and what is being tested, refer to https://github.com/rhysbartholomaeus/leafletQt_QML

This C++ implementation has a few additional features that the QML one doesn't:
* Clearing track layer
* Clearing overlays
* Updating the overlay list when an overlay is deleted
