# leafletQt_CPP
A Qt application with an embedded leaflet display - Test purposes only

This is the C++ implementation. For a breakdown of leaflet and what is being tested, refer to https://github.com/rhysbartholomaeus/leafletQt_QML

This implementation is missing a number features when compared to the QML variant. It is merely here to demonstrate the ability to connect C++ to a HTML / Javascript application.
